1. How does light interact differently with different objects in real life? Give 3 examples
When light interacts with diferent objects it is transmitted, relfelcted, absorbed, refracted, polarized, diffracted, or scattered 
this is depending on the compistion of the object and wavelength of the light
The frist example would be for reflection we can think of a pool of water, with the reflection it is being absorbed providing a clear image in the pool
The second example is when light is abosring into an object would be a black sweater and the sun, the sun is producing the light therefore the sweater absorbs the light and makes the sweater hot
The third example is when light is being transmitted through objects we can think of a empty glass cup, when light hits it, there is a glare and a clear reflection coming from it.

2. Why do objects appear to have different colors to our eyes
Becuase they absorb the colors surrounding us and trasmit them into other colors. 
The colors that we see are the wavelengths and transmitted into differnt colors

3. What's the advantage of using YUV color space
They are more efficient in coding and reducing the bandwidth more than RGB capture can.

4. How are colors added differently for lights compared to paint? What does R+G+B equal to in each case
Mixing given colorspairs together will bring different results in light and pigment, if we add more colors then the color will darken, but when put in light it will be paler
Paint will absorb the light and will become a lighter color than when it was originally.

5. Why are green screens green? 
Becasue it has to be a color that is not used often and green has nothing to do with the person's skin tone. 
Becuase of the color it allows the refection to be reflected off therefore absoring any othe colors around it.

6. Why is tone mapping needed for HDR images?
To reproduce the appearance of images having a higher dynmaic range than reproducing media such as prints and standard monitors 

7. Whats the realtionship between the wavelength of the light and the color of the light?
Within each color there is a different wavelength, when all the wavelengths are shown tigether they make a white light
